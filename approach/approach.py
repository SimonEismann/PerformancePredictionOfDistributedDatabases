# Our approach consists of three main steps.
# 1. Choose appropriate robust metric for analyzing the data (Done offline by metricAnalyzer.py)
# 2. Dynamically select the right amount of measurement repetitions of each data point until a certain threshold of measurement accuracy is met
# 3. Dynamically select the next point of the measurement space, required to be sampled in order to increase the accuracy of the model
